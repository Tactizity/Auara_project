Project for the development of solar water pumps  (IMH Elgoibar)


700 Million people lack adequate access to safe water.

    In drought-affected areas of Kenya, women must walk miles to find water, risking violence or animal attack, in order to sustain their families and animals. They do this with the knowledge that the dirty water they have collected may well make their children very ill.

    Using the overabundance of sunshine, the solar pump draws water from a 100-metre-deep well, providing families with the water that they desperately need and rendering cases of water-related diseases a thing of the past.
